  rulesObjectivePart1: "Avalon is a game of hidden loyalties. Players are either Loyal Servants " +
    "of Arthur fighting for Goodness and honor or aligned with the evil ways of " +
  	"Mordred. Good wins the game by successfully completing three Quests. Evil " +
  	"wins if three Quests end in failure. Evil can also win by assassinating Merlin " +
  	"at the game's end or if a Quest cannot be undertaken.",
  rulesObjectivePart2: "Players may make any claims during the game, at any point in the game. " +
  	"Discussion, deception, accusation, and logical deducation are all equally " + 
  	"important in order for Good to prevail or Evil to rule the day.",
  rulesGamePlayPart1: "The game consists of several different rounds. Each round has a team building " +
    "phase in which a party leader proposes a team to complete a quest. In each quest, the players " +
    "who are part of the quest will vote for it to succeed or fail. The Loyal Servants aim to succeed " +
    "in the quests while the Minions seek to quietly sabotage three of the five quests. Therefore, " +
    "the Knights must figure out the identity of the Minions and veto unsuccessful parties.",
  rulesGamePlayPart2: "Choose your team wisely. Approve only teams where you trust everyone. Even a single " +
    "evil player on the team is enough for failure.",
  rulesTeamBuildPart1: "After appropriate discussion, the Leader proposes a party. The Leader can " +
    "be on the team, but it is not required. Discussion is important, all players should participate in " +
    "helping the Leadere make the right choice for players to be on the team.",
  rulesTeamVotePart1: "After appropriate discussion, the Leader calls for a vote on the team assignment. " +
    "Every player can vote whether to accept or reject the party. Knights should reject the party if " +
    "they suspect a Minion to be in the party while Minions should strive to approve parties that they've " +
    "infiltrated.",
  rulesQuestPart1: "Each player in the party must vote whether to succeed or fail the quest in secret. " +
    "While Minions are aiming to fail the quests, they should be careful not to let the Knights catch on " +
    "to their identity.",
  rulesEndPart1: "The game ends immediately when three quests succeed or three quests fail. " + 
    "Knights will win if three quests succeed. Evil wins if three quests fail. Evil will also win if " +
    "the players can't come to agreement on a party and teams are vetoed 5 times in a row. ",
  rulesEndPart2: "If three quests succeed, then Evil has one finale chance to win the game by having the " +
    "player who has the role 'Assassin' to identify and assassinate Merlin. If the Assassin chooses " +
    "correctly, then Evil wins. However, if the Assassin is wrong, then Good wins.",
